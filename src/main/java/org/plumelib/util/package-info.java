 *
 * <h3 id="Collections_and_iterators">Collections and iterators</h3>
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.ArraysPlume ArraysPlume}
 *   <dd>Utilities for manipulating arrays and collections. This complements java.util.Arrays and
 *       java.util.Collections.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.CollectionsPlume CollectionsPlume}
 *   <dd>Utilities for manipulating collections, iterators, lists, maps, and sets.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.LimitedSizeSet LimitedSizeSet}
 *   <dd>LimitedSizeSet stores up to some maximum number of unique values, at which point its rep is
 *       nulled, in order to save space. <br>
 *       There is also {@link org.plumelib.util.LimitedSizeIntSet LimitedSizeIntSet}, which takes
 *       less memory than LimitedSizeSet&lt;Integer&gt;.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.WeakHasherMap WeakHasherMap}
 *   <dd>WeakHashMap is a modified version of WeakHashMap from JDK 1.2.2, that adds a constructor
 *       that takes a {@link org.plumelib.util.Hasher Hasher} argument.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.WeakIdentityHashMap WeakIdentityHashMap}
 *   <dd>WeakIdentityHashMap is a modified version of WeakHashMap from JDK 1.5, that uses
 *       System.identityHashCode() rather than the object's hash code.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.OrderedPairIterator OrderedPairIterator}
 *   <dd>Given two sequences/iterators/whatever, OrderedPairIterator returns a new
 *       sequence/iterator/whatever that pairs the matching elements of the inputs, according to
 *       their respective sort orders. (This opertation is sometimes called "zipping".)
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.ReflectionPlume ReflectionPlume}
 *   <dd>Utilities for manipulating reflection, class loaders, etc.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h3 id="Text_processing">Text processing</h3>
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.EntryReader EntryReader}
 *   <dd>Class that reads "entries" from a file. In the simplest case, entries can be lines. It
 *       supports: include files, comments, and multi-line entries (paragraphs). The syntax of each
 *       of these is customizable.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.RegexUtil RegexUtil}
 *   <dd>Utility methods for regular expressions, most notably for testing whether a string is a
 *       regular expression.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.FileIOException FileIOException}
 *   <dd>Extends IOException by also reporting a file name and line number at which the exception
 *       occurred.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.StringBuilderDelimited StringBuilderDelimited}
 *   <dd>Like StringBuilder, but adds a delimiter between each pair of strings that are insered into
 *       the Stringbuilder. This can simplify the logic of programs and also avoid errors.
 *       <!--  <dt>{link org.plumelib.util.CountingPrintWriter CountingPrintWriter}
 *   <dd>Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream counting the number of
 *       bytes and characters printed.
 * -->
 *       <!--
 *   <dt>{link org.plumelib.util.Digest Digest}
 *   <dd>Computes a message digest for a file.
 * -->
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h3 id="Math">Math</h3>
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.MathPlume MathPlume}
 *   <dd>Mathematical utilities.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.FuzzyFloat FuzzyFloat}
 *   <dd>Routines for doing approximate ('fuzzy') floating point comparisons. Those are comparisons
 *       that only require the floating point numbers to be relatively close to one another to be
 *       equal, rather than exactly equal.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h3 id="Random_selection">Random selection</h3>
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.RandomSelector RandomSelector}
 *   <dd>Selects k elements uniformly at random from an arbitrary iterator, using <em>O(k)</em>
 *       space.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.MultiRandSelector MultiRandSelector}
 *   <dd>Like RandomSelector, performs a uniform random selection over an iterator. However, the
 *       objects in the iteration may be partitioned so that the random selection chooses the same
 *       number from each group.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h3 id="java-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.DeterministicObject DeterministicObject}
 *   <dd>A version of <tt>Object</tt> with a deterministic <tt>hashCode()</tt> method. Instantiate
 *       this instead of <tt>Object</tt> to remove a source of nondeterminism from your programs.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.GraphPlume GraphPlume}
 *   <dd>Graph utility methods. This class does not model a graph: all methods are static.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.Intern Intern}
 *   <dd>Utilities for interning objects. Interning is also known as canonicalization or
 *       hash-consing: it returns a single representative object that <tt>.equals()</tt> the object,
 *       and the client discards the argument and uses the result instead.
 *   <dt>{@link org.plumelib.util.UtilPlume UtilPlume}
 *   <dd>Utility functions that do not belong elsewhere in the plume package.
 * </dl>
